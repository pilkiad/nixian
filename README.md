# Nixian

This repo is my giving up.
I have destroyed my operating system so often, that I am going to refrain from
customizing to much in the future. I'm hoping that I can create a simple setup
project that will install all necessary tools for me to get to working relatively
quickly so that if I break things again its not hard to pick up where I left of.

## Setting up the OS

1. Install debian stable
2. Pick xfce as the initial window manager

## Add user to sudoers file

```bash
su
sudo usermod -aG sudo username
```

## Startpage

There is a `startpage.html` that you may use in your browser if you don't want
to add the bookmarks everytime.
